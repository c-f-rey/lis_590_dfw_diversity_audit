# Week 9 Reflection

This week I compiled the diversity audit report. This report took considerably more time than I had expected. I spent a lot of time editing trying to strike the right tone. I wanted to write a report for Jennifer, as she is the primary audience, but I also wanted to write it in a way that would be accessible to the general public. I spent a lot of time on the data visualizations, as I wanted to provide proper context so that they would be legible if viewed without a thorough understanding of the project or the collection. 

This all went well, and I am satisfied with the report. I decided to [post the report on Medium](https://medium.com/@franklinreyconnor/diversity-audit-of-stevenson-elementary-school-librarys-folktale-collection-b1d77c874ae0), as I hope it can reach a wider audience and be of assistance to anyone wishing to assess the diversity of their collections.

As stated previously, the computational analysis and subsequent report took much longer than expected, and I am beginning to worry I will not have time to provide weeding and selection suggestions as I had hoped. I will see how much I can accomplish next week.
