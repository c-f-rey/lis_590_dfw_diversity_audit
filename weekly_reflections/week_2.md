# Week 2 Reflection

I began my work before visiting campus on Friday by creating my [data collection survey form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScca_UvlLA3Af4BP7ffaCNNddyrDZQnxr_yNbtJBgMnCGVHVQ/viewform). I borrowed the types of information collected from the Cedar Rapids Public Library diveristy audit conducted and discussed by Sarah Voels in _Auditing Diversity in Library Collections_. I chose this methodology becuase it allows for physcial evaluation of each book and collection of data that is not present in book metadata. It might not be appropriate for larger collections, but since I am only evaluating the folk tale section, this approach seemed appropriate.

This week was my first week working at the elementary school. I started with a tour given by my supervisor. It was wonderful to see such a diverse student population in a vibrant (and recently constrcuted) school building. I began my work on data collection. I made immediate changes to the collection form as I began handling books. At first I thought collecting call numbers would be sufficient IDs for books, but it became clear quickly that barcodes were more unique. Additionally, I began adding more sections of identity groups represented to allow for more granularity in the data analysis, hopefully it will not be too much information to work with.
