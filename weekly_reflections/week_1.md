# Week 1 Reflection

This week was mostly backend work, filling out paperwork to get approved to work on campus. I met with my supervisor to discuss my approach and check in on her priorities for the collection. She expressed a desire for more modern books, from a greater diversity of cultures that reflect the diversity of her student population. Additionally, she is hoping for information on the amount of Spanish-language materials. The audit will provide valuable insights to make priorities for weeding and purchases.
