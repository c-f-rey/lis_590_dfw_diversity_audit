# Week 5 Reflection

I worked from home this week to get a head start on data wrangling and analysis. Thankfully, my R skills are being refreshed due to my work as a Reader/Grader for the Intro to Data Science for Librarianship class (great idea me, high five). 

Already the data analysis confirms things I was noticing anecdotally. The collection is remarkably old. The average and median data of publication is 1996. Furthermore, the most represented identity groups are animals and mythical beasts. Somewhat surprisingly, BIPOC representation in the collection is relatively high -- 5 titles less than white cishet able-bodied representation. Though obviously, this is still an overrepresentation of whiteness given the global nature of the collection. Furthermore, the collection is predominantly English, with (I believe, need to find the data to back this up) insufficient Spanish-language materials for the student population.

I want to illustrate through data visualizations the complete lack of representation of the LGBTQIA+ community and people with disabilities.

Additionally, I am having trouble thinking through how to illustrate the breakdown of representation of people vs. animals in stories from the Global South vs. the Global North.
