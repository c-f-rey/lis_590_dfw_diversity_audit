# Week 6 Relfection

Data analysis went slow this week. I am running into trouble with a lot of my data wrangling but I know I will get there! I helped out a lot with students in the library, as well. As the librarian put it today, these students come from such diverse backgrounds, and have such individual needs that really require individual attention. But there's only one library and (ideally) a couple of helpers with each class! Fund school libraries more!!!

We did our mid-quarter reflection today, which was a nice reminder that progress is going well despite my hiccups today!
