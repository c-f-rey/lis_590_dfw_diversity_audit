# Week 6 Relfection

Data analysis went slow this week. I am running into trouble with a lot of my data wrangling but I know I will get there! I helped out a lot with students in the library, as well. As the librarian put it today, these students come from such diverse backgrounds, have such indivudal needs that really requires individual attentation. But there's only one library and (ideally) a couple of helpers with each class! Fund school libraries more!!!
