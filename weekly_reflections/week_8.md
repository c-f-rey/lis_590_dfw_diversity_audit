# Week 8 Reflection

This week I did not get as much computational analysis as I was hoping, but that is alright, I was able to collect some illuminating demographic information on Stevenson's student population, as well as create some data visualizations. Stevenson's student body is quite diverse -- 45% Asian, 40% Latino, 6% Black and White respectively, and 3% more than one race students according to the school's report. I haven't crunched the numbers yet, but I would estimate that at least a fourth of the collection depicts white people, and almost half depicts animals.

As I think I've mentioned before, I don't think depicting animals is necessarily a bad thing in these stories. I think it illustrates a unique challenge in assessing diversity in a folktale collection -- specifically, these collections include stories from cultures around the world from a wide variety of time periods. The vast majority of stories are not set in a contemporary context that is immediately relatable to these students. How can I best convey that this collection is or is not representative of this student population? There are some glaring issues:

- Most books are quite old
- There's a clear lack of racial diversity
- Although I did not collect information on the author's identity, anecdotally it was clear that the vast majority of authors -- especially those telling stories from Native American and African cultures -- are white.
- Definite lack of materials in languages other than English. Stevenson's student population are 60% ELL and 68% first language other than English.
