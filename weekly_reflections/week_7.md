# Week 7 Reflection

This week I made some progress on data analysis. I am kicking myself a bit over how I structured this dataset, as it is making analysis somewhat difficult. Here are some of my lessons learned in the hope they help with future audits:

- Make a data dictionary before collecting data and stick to it. Looking back through the data, I can tell I was not as consistent in my tagging early on, and I collected a lot of data that I am not using. Things solidified as I reviewed more books, but I think what I should have done was review a subset of books, 50 or so, to get familiar with the collection and use that information to structure my data intake process to ensure its relevance and consistency. I think this would also allow me to do take more time to consider how I want to collect demographic information and ensure I am respectful and consistent with my language.
- Don't collect representation information in one column. This makes analysis quite difficult. What I think would be better in the future would be to collect each identifier data point (race/ethnicity, geographic scope, etc.) as a TRUE/FALSE value in their own respective columns. I think this would make the data more user-friendly.

I don't think the current structure of my dataset will prevent me from doing the analysis I want to do. It's just taking me a lot of time to figure it out!! I want to compare the representation of animals/vs people across cultures. A professor offered to help me figure out the code to achieve this goal, so hopefully they can make sense of my data!
