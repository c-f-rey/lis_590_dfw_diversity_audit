# LIS 590: Directed Fieldwork at Stevenson Elementary School Conducting Diversity Audit

## Table of Contents

## General Information

My name is Connor Franklin Rey. I am a second-year residential student in the University of Washington iSchool's MLIS program. This is my artifact repository for my Fall '23 Directed Field Work with Stevenson Elementary School Library. The focus of this DFW is to conduct a diversity audit of the fairytale section, suggest books for weeding, and -- if time allows -- suggest purchases to fill gaps in the collection.

The [weekly reflections folder](https://github.com/c-f-rey/lis_590_dfw_diversity_audit/tree/main/weekly_reflections) will contain written reflections from each week, as well as the final reflection.

The [artifacts](https://github.com/c-f-rey/lis_590_dfw_diversity_audit/tree/main/artifacts) folder will contain documentation of my work. Including the following:

Datasets() R script used for computational analysis, project report, and weeding suggestions.
